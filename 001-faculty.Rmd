David was one of the co-founders of the CBW in 1998. He has active
research interests in the application of machine learning to a wide range of computational
biology problems, from genomics to proteomics to metabolomics. In addition to running a large
computational biology lab, David also operates a large wet lab (analytical chemistry, molecular
biology, nanotechnology, cell biology, structural biology) supported by its own fabrication shop
and electrical engineering group.

#### Vasu Gautam

Dr. Vasu Gautam is the senior scientist and Bioinformatics Manager at Wishart Node, University
of Alberta. Vasu is intrigued by the diverse world of “omics” and their combined role in biological
research, be it proteomics, genomics, or metabolomics. Vasu has worked in both academia and
industry in the field of multi-omics. His interest has been to explore the different aspects of these
“omics” groups and then combine this knowledge pool to address some of the most difficult
questions in the field. Bioinformatics/computational biology has been a great tool in enhancing
this capability and continuing his research. His current focus is the study of machine learning
algorithms and their applications in different areas of metabolomics.

#### Mark Berjanskii

>Research Associate <br>
Department of the Biological Sciences <br>
University of Alberta <br>

>
> --- mb1@ualberta.ca

Mark obtained a Ph.D. in Biochemistry at University of Missouri-Columbia, USA. Mark's
research interests include NMR metabolomics, bioinformatics, protein NMR structure
determination, interactions, misfolding, and dynamics. Between 1996 and 2004, he worked as a
member of several research teams that studied the Hsp70-Hsp40 chaperone system. Mark
joined Dr. Wishart's group at University of Alberta in 2004. Between 2005 and 2013, Mark
studied prion proteins that, when misfolded, cause Mad Cow Disease in cattle and similar
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease in humans. Since 2004, he has been involved in developing several
programs for analysis of protein structure and dynamics, such as Random Coil Index, Preditor,
GeNMR, CS23D, PROSESS, Resolution-by-proxy, and Gamdy, as well as bioinformatic
analysis and NMR metabolomics.

Sagan is a data scientist at the Wishart Node, University of Alberta. His
research is based around machine learning and multi-omics with a focus on data curation and
database design.

#### Michelle Brazas

Dr. Michelle Brazas is the Associate Director for Adaptive Oncology at the Ontario
Institute for Cancer Research (OICR), and acting Scientific Director at Bioinformatics.ca.
Previously, Dr. Brazas was the Program Manager for Bioinformatics.ca and a faculty member in
Biotechnology at BCIT. Michelle co-founded and runs the Toronto Bioinformatics User Group
(TorBUG) now in its 11th season, and plays an active role in the International Society of
Computational Biology where she sits on the Board of Directors and Executive Board.

#### Nia Hughes

> --- nia.hughes@oicr.on.ca

Nia is the Program Manager for Bioinformatics.ca, where she coordinates
the Canadian Bioinformatics Workshop Series. Prior to starting at OICR, she completed her
M.Sc. in Bioinformatics from the University of Guelph in 2020 before working there as a
bioinformatician studying epigenetic and transcriptomic patterns across maize varieties.
